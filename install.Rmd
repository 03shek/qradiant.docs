Radiant is a platform-independent browser-based interface for business analytics in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), based on the [Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) package. Developed by <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/nijs/" target="_blank">Vincent Nijs</a>. Please use the issue tracker on GitHub to suggest enhancements or report problems: <a href="https://github.com/radiant-rstats/radiant/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/radiant-rstats/radiant/issues</a>.

> Note: You may see the two messages below pop-up when installing `TinyTex`. This is expected and nothing to worry about. Just click "OK" and let the install process continue.

## Installing R, Rstudio, and Radiant on macOS

For Mac, first download and install R from <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/base/R-latest.pkg" target="_blank">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/</a>. Download the .pkg file, double-click, and follow the prompts. After R has been installed, open R, copy-and-paste the command below into R, and press return. Accept all default settings during the install process:

> Note: To install R 3.6.2 on macOS Catalina, right-click on the installer and select "Open".

```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radiant-rstats/minicran/gh-pages/install.R")
```

For a video tutorial see the `Installing R, Rstudio, and Radiant on macOS` video below:

> Note: It is possible that you will be asked for your password during the install process to correct permission settings for the directory /usr/local/bin. If there is still an error installing `tinytex` please run the command below from the "terminal" app in macOS

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local/bin; R -e "tinytex::install_tinytex()"
```

## Installing R, Rstudio, and Radiant on Linux

The first step will be to install R and a several additional linux tools. The commands required for Ubuntu 18.04 are shown below:

```sh
## Appends the CRAN repository to your sources.list file
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'

## Add GPG key of Michael Rutter the Ubuntu archives CRAN maintainer
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E084DAB9
sudo apt-get update

## Install R and required linux tools
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev libicu-dev \
  unixodbc-dev libpq-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev libcairo2-dev cargo libgsl-dev

## Download and install Rstudio (preview)
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
wget -O rstudio-preview-amd64.deb https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-ide-build/desktop/bionic/amd64/rstudio-1.2.1335-amd64.deb
sudo gdebi rstudio-preview-amd64.deb
rm rstudio-preview-amd64.deb
```

Run the following command to install the required R-packages for a user:

```r
R -e "source('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radiant-rstats/minicran/gh-pages/update.R')"
```

To make R-packages available to all users on a linux system run the command below instead:

```r
sudo su -c "R -e \"source('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radiant-rstats/minicran/gh-pages/update.R')\""
```

To ensure that all packages are available and up to date use:

```r
R -e "radiant.update::radiant.update()"
```

or

```r
sudo su -c "R -e 'radiant.update::radiant.update()'"
```

<!--
## Installing the development version of Radiant

To get the development version of Radiant, restart your Rstudio session and use the code below

```r
packages <- c(
  "radiant.data", "radiant.design", "radiant.basics",
  "radiant.model", "radiant.multivariate", "radiant"
)
ret <- sapply(
  packages,
  install.packages,
  repos = c(
    "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran/dev/",
    "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran/"
  )
)
```

If you want to revert to the current release version of Radiant, restart your Rstudio session and use the code below

```r
packages <- c("radiant.data", "radiant.design", "radiant.basics", "radiant.model", "radiant.multivariate", "radiant")
sapply(packages, install.packages, repos = "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran/")
```
-->

## Starting, Stopping, and Updating Radiant

I recommend you use Rstudio to run the Radiant application. When you open Rstudio you can start Radiant through the `Addins` menu at the top of the screen `Start radiant (browser)`. If for some reason the `Start radiant (browser)` is not shown in the dropdown, enter `radiant::radiant()` in the Rstudio console. To close the application click the <i title='Power off' class='fa fa-power-off'></i> icon in the navigation bar and then click `Stop`. The Radiant process will stop and the browser window will close or gray-out.

To add an option to upgrade Radiant easily, use the commands below to install the `radiant.upgrade` package. You should now see two new item in the `Addins` dropdown that you can use for future radiant upgrades.

```r
install.packages("radiant.update", repos = "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran/")
radiant.update::radiant.update()
```



## Sharing Rstudio projects with others

An excellent way to share an Rstudio project hosted online (e.g., on Dropbox) with others is to use the `usethis` package

```r
install.packages("usethis")
?usethis::use_course
```

As an example, run the command below to download and open an Rstudio project. Note the "1" at the end of the URL instead of Dropbox's default which is "0".

```r
usethis::use_course("https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0dmcr2xsphtn1ha/AADsrYsi8KBkddWx_B-aQbi1a?dl=1")
```

## Installing additional R-development tools

To install additional development tools (i.e., Rtools, git, homebrew) copy-and-paste the command below into R or Rstudio and press return. When installing Rtools, Windows users should make sure to check the option to add Rstools to the system path.

```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radiant-rstats/minicran/gh-pages/install_dev.R")
```

## Documentation

Documentation and tutorials for each of the apps are available at <https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/> and in the Radiant web interface (the <i title='Help' class='fa fa-edit'></i> icons on each page and the <i title='Help' class='fa fa-question-circle'></i> icon in the navigation bar). See also the [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown) documentation sites:

* http://radiant-rstats.github.io/radiant.data
* http://radiant-rstats.github.io/radiant.design

## Trouble shooting

Windows users may need to start R and Rstudio `as administrator`. On rare occasions R(studio) may complain that a package is not yet installed when starting Radiant. If so, install the package mentioned using the command below but replace 'package-that-is-not-yet-installed' with the package name mentioned in the error message

```r
install.packages("package-that-is-not-yet-installed", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com", type = "binary")
```

or copy-and-paste the commands below into R to check if any required packages have not yet been installed

```r
install.packages("radiant.update", repos = "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran/")
radiant.update::radiant.update()
```

Some users have reported that the Malwarebytes software can inappropriately block R-packages from being installed or updated. If you use Malwarebytes and are experiencing problems you can try (temporarily) turning it off during the install process or when upgrading.

If there is an error installing `tinytex` on macOS please run the command below from the "terminal" app:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local/bin; R -e "tinytex::install_tinytex()"
```
